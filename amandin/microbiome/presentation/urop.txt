The microbiome is an important part of the ecosystem despite not being visible to the naked eye. Here we see two mice, but one of them is injected with a different microbial composition.

Waimea valley is a unique region in the fact that there is a huge diversity in environmental variables like elevation and rainfall. This makes it a prime place to study the effects of the microbiome and especially to learn more about the relationship between the microbiome and Hawaii endemic species. Such information could be useful in repopulating Kahoolawe and in understanding micrology around the world where it is hard to separate environment from species.

C-Maiki data collectors go out into the world with sampling devices (I imagine swabs) and take a sample at different points along Waimea Valley. Every sample will have a number of different DNA sequence fragments, and from that, the researchers are able to transform the fragments into a count of the number and type of microorganisms in the sample. The method will group DNA clusters by similarity resulting in an Organismal Taxonomix Unit or OTU. In the end, we are given the two following pieces of information, An abundance table, a table indexed by the sample ID and OTUs. So every row shows the OTUs in the given sample and every column will show how many of a given OTU appears in each sample. The metadata, a file containing information about each sample. Note, that because of the method of DNA clustering and the metadata table, we know much more about the samples the researchers took versus the OTU's. Hence, we shift our attention to the samples. The way we think about the sample is that it is a type of measure of the microbiome at each point where it is taken. Thus, with the collection of samples we can then try to understand how the samples vary throughout Waimea Valley.

Our mission is simple now, explore the data and try to recover some understanding of the distribution of the samples. 

Dr. Chyba and I come from a formal mathematical background over a formal biological background. However this allows us to have a unique advantage when it comes to the analysis. The standard approach to biological data is to look at measures of diversity like alpha and beta diversity, means, standard deviations, frequency tables, and hypothesis testing.

In math, researchers tend to look at an object of study and ask questions about it. The main object of attention, from math, in this project is the manifold. Manifolds is a name given to certain well behaved regions of space. We can 'walk' on the manifold and the number of directions we can choose to walk in is important to the behavior of the manifold.

In a computer, we use networks, called graphs, as a discretizations of manifolds.

We first have a table of samples which will be our points. We need some way of telling the computer how different each sample is from one another and what our connections will be. For this experiment we choose the 'nearest neighboor function' which stipulates that we will connect points that are close to each other by computing a standard distance function.  

Then we compute a matrix called the graph Laplacian. The idea is that this matrix is like a derivative of functions. It tells you how different a point is from it's neighboors. From this matrix we can look at how connected the points are in the network. For matrices there is a construct which gives a natural direction the data should follow called eigenvectors and their corresponding scaling value the eigenvalue. Here we see how they change depending on the connectedness of the graph.

Applying this entire procedure to our dataset yields the following curve in 3 dimensional space. This looks exactly like a 1 dimensional manifold, that means that there is essentially one direction to walk along the manifold. In terms of the interpretation this means that the samples taken depend entirely on one parameter. However we do not know what this one parameter is.

If we found the parameter for which these samples depend on we will find a gradient in color when we plot vs it. However using some preliminary searches by plotting versus elevation, rainfall, and distance from the shore we do not find this nice gradient. The parameter is most likely complex but it is definately there and thus is the future area of research.

Thank you for listening, any questions?
