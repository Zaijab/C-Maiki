*** Microbiome
**** Def: Species
An organism with a certain DNA sequence
**** Def: Sample
A specific location
**** Def: Abundance Table
A matrix of Sample vs Species
If [A[i,j] = n], then [There are n species i at sample j]
**** Histogram: Abundance vs Sample

The Microbiome folder will contain a Microbiome module
In the Microbiome module, you can create a Microbiome analysis class with a constructor that takes in a path to the data.
The object will have methods to plot certain figures.

The Data we are given is:
Abundance Table
