track metadata for outlier points 
split data into based on sample type (~5 types) and plot color coded data
maybe split data up into other categories too? 
deal with overlaps: transparent colors, or different size dots, 
do abundance vs present scatters again

do with filtered and unfiltered and compare
do simplist PCA on rows as vectors only find 2 largest eig set and project everything on that (and plot)


notes 
low presence could correspond to difference in soil vs insect gut 


find presence of total data under 10

compare outlier species, what is their dissimilarity measure? 
compare to genetic/taxanomic data, how close are the outliers with each other(species wise)? 
compare outlier samples?  focus on smaples with presence larger than 1
look at species with 40 - 80 presence and compare those 
look at abundance for those species (look at the 25 species with presence 40)

extract slope and intercept from linear regression 


metadata sampleID is not unique. each ID has two samples a fungi and a bacteria
matching table means appending more rows NOT COLUMNS the metadata matches sites 
not species and match using sample barcode

use NCBI BLAST to measure genetic similarity or use minimap 2 and then use emboss stretcher to compare
aligntment algorithm: needleman wunsch 
in abundance data keep numerical identifier for smaple name (remove .fastq)

    integrate with qualitative info -- color the data 
    redo hist/scat for each fungi/animal/plant/nonhost and add these as rows at the end of data
